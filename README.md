## Hi there ðŸ‘‹   My name is Paul...

...and I started exploring the world of open-source contributions in May 2024.

I started by contributing to newbie issues on GitHub in the open-sauced/guestbook and open-sauced/pizza-verse repos.

I have been a senior software engineer for various Fortune 500 companies (Qualcomm, Humana, etc.) and a military contractor for USAF, USN, etc.  

All of my work (up until 2016) has been on ASP.NET web applications using MS Visual Studio, C#, MS Team Foundation Server, and MS SQL Server.  

I have my bachelor's from SDSU and web-technology certifications from UCSD in C++, C#, ASP.NET, and Java.

I just finished coursework in Python & Django (on HyperSkill.com), finished a Python course at Mesa Community College, and am looking forward to moving on to Node.js.

I currently use PyCharm and VS Code as my IDEs, but I have used Visual Studio, Netbeans, Eclipse, and Android Studio.

I hope to phase in contributing to some projects on GitHub, but other than contributing to open-sauced and GitHub learning repos, I don't yet know where I can be useful.

You can reach me either here -- or through my profile on LinkedIn.com.  (I've included the link here on my profile.)

Thanks for readin'! :)
