## Hi there ðŸ‘‹   My name is Paul...

...and I started exploring the world of open-source contributions in May 2024.

I started by contributing to newbie issues on GitHub in the open-sauced/guestbook and open-sauced/pizza-verse repos.

I have been a senior software engineer for various Fortune 500 companies (Qualcomm, Humana, etc.) and a military contractor for USAF, USN, etc.  

All of my work (up until 2016) has been on ASP.NET web applications using MS Visual Studio, C#, MS Team Foundation Server, and MS SQL Server.  

I have my bachelor's from SDSU and web-technology certifications from UCSD in C++, C#, ASP.NET, and Java.

I recently earned certificates in both Python, Django, Kotlin, and Node.js/React (from Hyperskill) and completed Python coursework at Mesa Community College.

I currently use VS Code, IntelliJ, PyCharm, and Webstorm as my IDEs, but I have experience using Visual Studio, Netbeans, Eclipse, and Android Studio.

You can reach me either here -- or through my profile on LinkedIn.com.  (I've included the link here on my profile.)

Thanks for readin'! :)
